# CryptoBot
The project was developed only by me in a span of a few days.
## Project summary
A Discord channel bot that has commands for:
* Getting the current price of a cryptocurrency and 24-hour change in %
* Getting 24-hour volume of a cryptocurrency
* Checking if a cryptocurrency is supported by the bot
* Getting a list of supported cryptocurrencies

## Why this project?
The main reason I choose to make this project is that I have a Discord channel and I'm highly into crypto. I couldn't find a Discord crypto bot that was free and fast so I decided to make my own.
The second reason - I had taken a course in Python a long time ago and never used it since, so I wanted to see how quickly can I recap it. I was glad that I was able to refresh my Python skills quickly by doing this simple project.

## What did I learned?
* Recaped my Python skills
* Learned to use an API
* Learned to make Discord Bots
